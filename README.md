# pokemon_website
A full-stack Pokémon web app built to strengthen my skills in React, Node.js/Express, and PostgreSQL. This project demonstrates my ability to design RESTful APIs, structure relational databases, and deliver responsive, user-friendly interfaces—while combining my passion for Pokémon with real-world development practices.
